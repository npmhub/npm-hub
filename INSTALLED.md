# Thanks for installing npmhub!

There's nothing to configure. Just surf around on GitHub and whenever you're viewing a repo with npm dependencies, you'll see them listed below the README. For a good example, check out these two dependency lists:

- [**github.com**/sindresorhus/delay#dependencies](https://github.com/sindresorhus/delay#dependencies)
- [**github.com**/fregante/github-url-detection#dependencies](https://github.com/fregante/github-url-detection#dependencies)
